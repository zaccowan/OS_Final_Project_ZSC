# OS_Final_Project_ZSC

**Work in progress final project for Operating Systems class at Bellarmine University.**
<br>
<br>

The project seeks to use an Http Server to model some important dynamics of system regulation. 
<br>
The main focus of this project is using ***multiple threads of execution while simultaneously maintaining a critical section.***

## My Specific Application

The application I am building is a server that allows users to chat, send and recieve files, and also to manage some server information (name, description, etc).
<br>
There is no database management going on since the focus of this project is managing read/write access of each client. This will be done using mutual exclusion or a form of semaphore. 

## Features I Might Add for Fun
- GUI so clients can have a better experience than a console based interface
